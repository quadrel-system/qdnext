WebPrototypingTool increases handoff velocity with a set of robust features for user research and collaborating with engineering.

## Download prototype

You can also download your project as a zip file which contains all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files needed to run your prototype. This might be useful is you need to run a prototype locally, or host it on a web server.

To export as a zip file, click `Download project zip`, located in the upper right overflow menu on the **project panel**.

## Export HTML & CSS

For individual [boards](/basics/boards) or [components](/components-guide/), you can directly export the HTML or CSS. This is particularly beneficial for handing of prototype code to engineers for development purposes. To export code, right click on any board or component and select the **Export Code** menu option, then either **Copy HTML** or **Copy CSS**.

Select a component and open the [code tab](/beyond-the-basics/component-overrides/) in the properties panel to see which CSS attributes have been applied to the component's container.

## Exporting Themes

[Themes](/theme) can also be exported. The entire design system can be exported to JSON data format. You can also import design system data from other projects. This is particularly useful when you need to share design systems between difference projects.

From the theme panel, select the **Export design system** menu option from the drop-down menu the upper right corner.

You man also find the need to export the design system CSS variables. This might be useful if you need to integrate the WebPrototypingTool CSS variables with external code.

To export all CSS variables, select the `Export CSS vars` menu option from the theme panel options menu.
