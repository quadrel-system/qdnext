The Marketplace provides a way to share components ([Composed](/components/composed/) & [Code](/components/code-components/)) across projects and with others. To get started, click the <i class="ico btm">shopping_cart</i> icon at the top of the Components panel.

Within the Marketplace, browse community contributed components or select `Mine` to just see yours. [Code](/components/code-components/) can be identified by the <i class="ico btm">code</i> icon in the top left. Multiple components can be imported at once by selecting and clicking the **Add selected** button.

Components added from the marketplace will appear in the `Custom` section in the components panel where they can be dragged into a [board](/basics/boards/) to create a new instance.

When imported, a **copy** of the original component is made just for the current project. This means a component can be modified without worrying if it will affect other projects. To edit an imported component, simply double-click or use the menu in the components panel.

**Note:** If the owner of a component publishes a new version, your copy will need to be removed and re-added. Also, there are currently no notifications for new versions. This is something the WebPrototypingTool teams is working on.

To publish a component, see the guide for each of the following:

- [Code Components](/components/code-components/#publishing)
- [Composed Components](/components/composed/#publishing)
