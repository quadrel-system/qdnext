### Prefer absolute position

### Layers indent lines

The option adds visually indented lines to the layers tree. This option may be beneficial for complex, nested trees with many elements.

### Disable contextual overlay

The contextual overlay menu is the [floating menu](/basics/editor/#context-menus) displayed to the right of each selected element in the design surface. It may be preferred to disable this menu if you do not find it useful.
